# Meet FSNotes 7

## Hello

![](assets/logo.png)

Hi folks!

I keep improving the app, adding new features and removing everything that has become outdated. I simply can’t make peace with bad code, bad design, or a bad user interface. So I apologize to users if I suddenly removed a feature you were used to — it means only one thing: I can’t implement it at a level of quality I’m satisfied with.

FSNotes 7 supports iOS 18 and iOS 26.

## New 

Apple redesigned the system UI once again, which meant updating the app’s design yet again — as a result, all iOS 26 users will get the new Liquid Glass design.

Fresh menus, search at the bottom of the controller, new toolbars, and more...

Editor performance has improved once again, thanks to rewriting the Syntax Highlighter from scratch in Swift. It now works natively and fast.

You can now add not only images but also files directly in the editor, just like in the desktop app. A full-fledged search function has also been added within the note. 

A huge number of bugs have been fixed, and much more.

All in all — let’s move forward and enjoy a new experience with FSNotes 7!
