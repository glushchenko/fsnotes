## 1. Introduction

Hi, my name is Alex and I am the author of this program. A few years ago, I discovered that my favorite note-taking application, nvALT, no longer starts.

None of the existing alternatives for macOS and iOS suited me, and since I have been developing for many years, I tried to write my own solution. In the summer of 2017, I published the source code of FSNotes on GitHub. It was a terrible application ðŸ¤¬. Terrible and with poor functionality. But I did not give up and contributors did not either.

At this time, FSNotes is translated into 8 languages and used across the globe. The number of features has exceeded one hundred, of which dozens are unique.

If you like this app - please support development, buy the application in [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/fsnotes/id1277179284) and [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/app/fsnotes-manager/id1346501102) for mobile FSNotes experience.

Kind Regards,
FSNotes author, Alex
