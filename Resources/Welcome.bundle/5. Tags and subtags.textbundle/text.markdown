# 5. Tags and subtags

FSNotes version 4 brings an amazing inline tags system. Tag notes simply by prepending a word with a hash (#). Like this: #hello. Or, subtag them like this: #hello/world. How deep can you sub-tag your notes? Well, #unlimited/sub/tags. Tags auto-complete, too. Type a hash and the first character for your tag and:

You can select multiple projects and multiple tags by holding `cmd` while selecting in sidebar.
