# 1. Introduction

Hi, friends!

A huge amount of work has gone into FSNotes 7. The editor has been sped up, the code highlighting engine has been rewritten, even more attention has been paid to the UI, and many other things you asked for made it into this release: https://github.com/glushchenko/fsnotes/milestone/5

Some features, such as the horizontal notes list, had to be removed — sorry about that. I can’t maintain them at a high level since I don’t use them myself.

As always, this update is free. The minimum system requirements for FSNotes 7 are macOS 12.4 and iOS 18.

If you like this app - please support development, buy the application in [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/fsnotes/id1277179284) and [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/app/fsnotes-manager/id1346501102) for mobile FSNotes experience.
