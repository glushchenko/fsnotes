# 1. Introduction

Hi, my name is Oleksandr and I am the author of this program. A few years ago, I discovered that my favorite note-taking application, nvALT, no longer starts.

None of the existing alternatives for macOS and iOS suited me, and since I have been developing for many years, I tried to write my own solution. In the summer of 2017, I published the source code of FSNotes on GitHub. It was a terrible application 🤬. Terrible and with poor functionality. But I did not give up and contributors did not either.

At this time, FSNotes is translated into 12 languages and used across the globe. The number of features has exceeded one hundred, of which dozens are unique.

If you like this app - please support development, buy the application in [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/fsnotes/id1277179284) and [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/app/fsnotes-manager/id1346501102) for mobile FSNotes experience.

Kind Regards,
FSNotes author, Oleksandr Hlushchenko
